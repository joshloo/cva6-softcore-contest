2.3	Third Party Use and Distribution.  

a.	Third Party Contractors.  Licensee may grant a sublicense to its Third Party Contractors to the use the IP Core in Configured Object Code or User Configurable Object Code only to program Lattice Devices and only during such time that a Third Party Contractor is providing services for Licensee and provided that Licensee complies with the following:  (i)  Licensee's agreement with each Third Party Contractor must be as protective of Lattice and the IP Core as the terms set forth in this Agreement; (ii) Licensee assumes full liability for all use of the IP Core by Third Party Contractors in compliance with the terms of this Agreement; (iii) a Third Party Contractor may only use the IP Core on the physical premises of Licensee or the premises of the Third Party Contractor; and (iv) each Third Party Contractor's use of the IP Core is for Licensee's benefit only.

b.	End Customers.  Licensee may grant a sublicense to its end customers to use the IP Core in Configured Object Code only to program Lattice Devices provided that Licensee's agreements with its end customers must be as protective of Lattice and the IP Core as the terms set forth in this Agreement.

3.	License Restrictions.  Except for the rights expressly granted herein, the title and all intellectual property rights in and to the IP Core remain the sole and exclusive property of Lattice or Lattice's licensors. Licensee agrees not to remove or destroy any copyright notices, proprietary markings, or confidential legends placed upon, contained within, or associated with the IP Core. Licensee will not distribute, copy, transfer, lend, incorporate, modify, or use the IP Core for any purpose except as expressly provided herein. If Licensee fails to comply with the provisions of this Agreement, the License is automatically terminated. Any use or attempted use of the IP Core in violation of the restrictions contained in this Agreement is a breach of this Agreement which will cause irreparable harm to Lattice, entitling Lattice to injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies, and will result in automatic termination of the License. 

4.	Critical Applications.  The IP Core is not designed, intended, authorized, or warranted for use as components in systems intended for surgical implant into the body, or in other applications intended to support or sustain life, or in any other application in which the failure of IP Core could create a situation where personal injury, death, or severe property or environmental damage may occur. Licensee assumes the risk of any use of the IP Core in such unintended or unauthorized applications, subject only to applicable laws governing limitations on product liability.  

5.	Source Code Restrictions.  Unless and to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law in a particular jurisdiction, Licensee will not attempt to reverse translate, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the IP Core. Any use or attempted use of the IP Core in violation of the foregoing restrictions is a breach of this Agreement which will cause irreparable harm to Lattice, entitling Lattice to injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies, and will result in automatic termination of the License.

6.	Payment.  In consideration of the license and other rights granted under this Agreement, Licensee shall pay the license fee specified by Lattice to Lattice or to a Lattice authorized distributor, as applicable, by the due date specified by Lattice or its authorized distributor.
