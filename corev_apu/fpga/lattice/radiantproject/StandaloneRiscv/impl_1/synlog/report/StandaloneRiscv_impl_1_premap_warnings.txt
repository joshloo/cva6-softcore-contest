@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT530 :"/home/anonymous/code/cva6-softcore-contest/corev_apu/fpga/lattice/scripts/lattice_ariane.sv":58725:2:58725:10|Found inferred clock cva6_avant|tck which controls 168 sequential elements including i_dmi_jtag.i_dmi_jtag_tap.tap_state_q[3]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may adversely impact design performance.
